            Now we are going to start the test, create a button that navigates to a subfolder called api. Make sure this button is 508 compliant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make an API get request for all the data at <u>https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/qqcv-ihn5.json</u>. This data will return all vacant buildings by neighborgood in Baltimore.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add an error handler.
        </li>
        <li>
            When request comes back display a <u>table</u> of all unique neighborhoods with the number of vacant buildings next to it. The table headers should be neighborhood and vacancies<br/>
            Ex: Sandtown | 56
        </li>
        <li>
            The table should display Total of vacancies in the bottom of the table
        </li>
        <li>
            Style the table so that the table header is bold, the second colomn in the table is blue and the table footer Total and Sum are bold and red.
        </li>
        <li>
            After this is completed review and refactor you code. Extra points are for mobile responsive layouts.
